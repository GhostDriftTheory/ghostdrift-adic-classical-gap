# **ADIC Fact-Checking Layer: Refuting "Classics Obsolescence" Discourse**

### **A GhostDrift Sociomathematical Paper: Formalizing Refutation via Σ₁-Type Witnesses**

**GhostDrift Mathematical Research Institute (ゴーストドリフト数理研究所) Official Demonstration**

This project is part of the **AI Safety & AI Accountability Project**, extending **Responsibility Engineering** to the domain of societal discourse. It demonstrates how to decouple emotional rhetoric from verifiable facts using the **ADIC (Anti-Doxa Immutable Certificate)** protocol.

In contemporary society, "Doxa" (unsubstantiated opinion) often masquerades as truth, influencing educational policy and cultural value without empirical verification. This demo formalizes the recurring "Classics Obsolescence" argument in Japan—asserting that Classical Japanese/Chinese are unnecessary—into a mathematical structure.

By reducing claims to factual propositions concerning "Time Cost," "International Trends," and "Learning Efficacy," we implement an **ADIC protocol** that verifies these claims against immutable datasets (Ledgers). The core logic utilizes **Σ₁-type (existential) proofs** to invalidate universal claims through the rigorous presentation of finite counter-examples (Witnesses).

## **💡 Why it Matters: Sealing Unsubstantiated Discourse**

Traditional fact-checking relies on "authority." ADIC relies on "logical necessity."

* **Fact vs Value Decoupling:** Responsibility Engineering requires a system to distinguish between what can be proven (Fact) and what is a matter of preference (Value).  
* **The Wedge of Data:** This system serves as a formal mechanism to seal the power of "Doxa" by driving a mathematical wedge of verified data into societal debates.  
* **Japan-Origin Responsibility:** As with Wasan 2.0, this protocol treats truth as a **Finite Procedure**. It proves that the "inevitability" of responsibility arises from identifying clear boundaries in a finite world.

## **⚙️ Core Technology: The ADIC Layer**

The paper demonstrates a three-tier architecture for discourse verification:

1. **The Ledger (Truth Source):** Immutable snapshots of curricula and empirical studies (e.g., MEXT data, IB standards, GPA correlation studies).  
2. **Σ₁ Verify Functions:** Primitive recursive functions that search for "Witnesses" ($w$). A single row in the Ledger (e.g., *Required hours \= 70*) acts as an existential proof to refute a universal claim (e.g., *Hours are excessive*).  
3. **Immutable Certificate:** A JSON-based object containing the claim type, verify parameters, and a pointer to the physical witness in the Ledger, secured by hash chains.

## **👁️ Features & Logic Flow**

* **Decomposition:** Breaking down the "Classics are Useless" argument into computable propositions (C1-C4).  
* **Witness Demonstration:** Showcasing real-world data (Gengo Bunka 70h, IB Latin 240h, Hauspie 2024 Study) as mathematical witnesses that halt the verification process with a "Refuted" status.  
* **Sensitivity Analysis:** Proving that the refutation is robust and does not depend on arbitrary constant settings.

## **⚓ Position in the GhostDrift Framework**

Within the GhostDrift framework, this project serves as the **Sociomathematical Application Layer**. It proves that **Responsibility Engineering** is not limited to power grids or prime numbers, but can be used to protect the "Logic of the Public Sphere."

This project is centrally managed by the **Crisis Management Investment Mathematics Task Force (危機管理投資数理対策本部)**, treating the integrity of cultural and educational discourse as an auditable societal asset.
